Backgroud
----------------------
Flow cytometry is a technique which could detect and measure characteristics of many thousand cells or particles per second. The high‐dimensional flow cytometry data have made it possible to detect protein marker expression, allowing cell populations to be characterized in unprecedented detail. Briefly speacking, the first step is going to be a clustering problem for high-dimensional data. 

FlowSOM is one of the available algorithms for flow cytometry and high-dimensional data analysis. According to Weber and Robinson(2016)[1], it "had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well‐suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high‐dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer."
