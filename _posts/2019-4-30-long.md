The Mannâ€“Whitney U test is the non-parametric alternative test to the independent sample t-test. It is used to compare two sample means that come from the same population, and used to test whether two sample means are equal or not.

Mann-Whitney U test is usually used in cases that data sample size is small. This test does not assume that the difference between the samples is normally distributed, that the variances of the two populations are equal or the two sample sizes are equal.
