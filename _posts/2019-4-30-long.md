The Mannâ€“Whitney U test is the non-parametric alternative test to the independent sample t-test. It is used to compare two sample means that come from the same population, and used to test whether two sample means are equal or not.

Mann-Whitney U test is usually used in cases that data sample size is small and it doesn't require two sample sizes to be equal or normal distribution.
